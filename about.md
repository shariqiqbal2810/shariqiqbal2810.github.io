I am currently a PhD student in the Computer Science department at The University of Southern California, advised by [Fei Sha](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha/). My research interests are motivated by examining the gaps between human and artificial intelligence, especially within the framework of reinforcement learning. Problems of particular interest to me include: reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, intrinsic motivation and exploration for reinforcement learning, multi-task learning, transfer learning, multi-modal learning, and unsupervised learning.

Previously, after graduating with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Duke University, I worked in a [Computational Neuroscience lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io/) run by [John Pearson](http://jmxpearson.com/), also at Duke. My work there included building a generative time-series model for inferring the latent dynamics in a 2-player game ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07319)).
