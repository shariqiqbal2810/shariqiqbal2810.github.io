I am currently a PhD student in the Computer Science department at The University of Southern California, advised by [Fei Sha](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha/). My research interests are primarily in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning. I am also interested in meta-learning, intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning, and transfer learning.

Previously, after graduating with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Duke University, I worked in a [Computational Neuroscience lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io/) run by [John Pearson](http://jmxpearson.com/), also at Duke. My work there included building a generative time-series model for inferring the latent dynamics in a 2-player game ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07319)).

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, producing [music](https://soundcloud.com/sharqq), watching Duke Basketball, and cooking.
