I am currently a PhD candidate in the Computer Science department at The University of Southern California, advised by [Fei Sha](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha/).
I got my start in research working in a [computational cognitive neuroscience lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io/) run by [John Pearson](http://jmxpearson.com/) at Duke University, after completing my bachelor's there.
My current research interests are in deep (primarily multi-agent) reinforcement learning.
Specifically I am motivated by solving complex cooperative tasks in which several forms of structure (sparse interactions, subtasks, etc.) exist.
My work aims to develop modeling strategies which leverage this structure to improve generalization as well as learning efficiency.

In my free time I enjoy playing soccer and basketball, playing video games, producing [music](https://soundcloud.com/sharqq), cooking, reading, hiking, and watching my favorite sports teams (Duke Basketball, Michigan Football, Tottenham, US Soccer).
