Here's a couple links to posts about some of the work I have been doing in lab!

[This post](https://pearsonlab.github.io/blog/2015/11/06/eye_tracking_tech.html) describes the method we have developed for dynamic object tracking in eye tracking videos, using OpenCV. We use this method to get gaze position coordinates relative to static objects, rather than the eye tracking glasses themselves, to assist in analysis. [This](https://pearsonlab.github.io/blog/2016/03/10/nasher_eye_tracking.html) is an application of the same techniques in an art museum. Both posts include some pretty cool videos that you will want to see!

Here is a [post](https://pearsonlab.github.io/blog/2015/11/20/pride_study.html) that details some of the predictive analytics work I did on a clinical dataset.

Finally, this is a [post](https://pearsonlab.github.io/blog/2016/04/06/opencv-videos.html) describing how I built a Docker container and Amazon AMI for OpenCV compiled with FFMPEG to allow for video generation. This compilation process turns out to be quite finicky and complicated, so we wanted an easy way for the users of our software to get set up.
